During this task we were given some code and asked to refactor it using useReducer.

This was tricky but we managed to do it in a reasonable amount of time.

The task instructions:

1.  In [index.js](src/components/App/index.js), outside of the `App` component, create a constant called `initialState` containing `{ quizResults: [] }` (which will later be used with `useReducer`).

2.  In [index.js](src/components/App/index.js), outside of the `App` component, create a reducer function (which will later be used with `useReducer`):

    - Remember that this reducer function should take in `state` and `action` and return the new, immutably updated state.

    - Implement the following action types within the reducer function:

      - `ADD_ANSWER`

        - The new state should immutably update the `quizResults` array and add the user's choice (e.g. either: `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`) to the end.
        - You'll need to make the user's choice available under the action's payload. (Remember that `action` will be whatever you `dispatch` in your app).

      - `RESET_ANSWERS`
        - The new state should immutably update the `quizResults` array to be an empty array.

    - Don't forget to add a default case that just returns the state as-is!

3.  In [index.js](src/components/App/index.js), import the `useReducer` hook and use it within your `App` component.

4.  When calling `useReducer`:

    - set your initial state to be `initialState` that you created above.
    - pass in the reducer function you've created above

5.  Complete the `handleAnswerClick` function in `App` so that it dispatches an `ADD_ANSWER` action type as well as the `choiceId` (either `a`, `b`, `c` or `d`). This should mean that when the user clicks a choice, their choice should get added to the `quizResults` array. Although this logic/setup isn't ideal (because a user might not answer the questions in order, or might answer a question more than once), just get it working and we can improve things later (see bonus tasks).

6.  Complete the `handleResetButtonClick` function in `App` so that it dispatches a `RESET_ANSWERS` action type. This should mean that when the user clicks the reset button, the `quizResults` array should become an empty array.

7.  The last step, of course, is to calculate the results! In the `calculateResults` function, use the state from your `useReducer` with all the answers collected. Your function should figure out which choice (`a`, `b`, `c`, or `d`) was clicked the most often and set the `result` state accordingly.

### Bonus:

ðŸŒŸ I know it's tempting, but only **after** you have your functionality working, **then** go into [`/libs/questionData.js`](src/libs/questionData.js), where you can replace the sample text for the questions and answers with your own text.

ðŸŒŸ Jazz up your page with CSS styling and animations. Get creative!

ðŸŒŸ Write some tests for your reducer function in [`app.test.js`](src/components/App/app.test.js) to make sure each case is functioning in the way that you expect.

ðŸŒŸ Experiment with conditional rendering. Can you make it so that the `ResultsDisplay` component only shows up after the button is pressed? Can you get each question to render one at a time? Can you get the questions to be hidden at the end of the quiz when the results show?

ðŸŒŸ If you still have time, keep customizing your app!

- Do you want to add more questions?
- Is there a way that you can shuffle the answer choices in different orders to make it less predictable, for example?
- Is there a way you can make sure a user can only click on one answer per question?
- ...and more! The sky's the limit.
